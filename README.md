App development project. A shopping/nutrition/expiration dates web application.
The app will let you input foods and/or recpies (can customize your own to input) into a shopping list. Once the shopping list is marked as complete, the app will let you see the calories and macros of the list everyday for X amount of time (like a week), the expiration dates of your items, and offer a multitude of tracking/data history and customization for notifications and reminders.

Dos:
                Inputs:
                    str: food
                    int/float: quantity of food
                    int: duration of time for shopping
                Specific food: 
                    str: names, 
                    str: expiration dates 
                    int: macros, fat, carbs, protein
                Alert/Reminders/UI:
                    Expiration date upcoming
                    Display macros for day/week as maybe a nice piechart
